        <h1>The Queen City</h1>
        <p>Charlotte, also known as the Queen City, is located in North Carolina. It is home to
            three different sports teams. Those teams include the Caronlina Hurricanes, Carolina
            Panthers, and my favorite, the Charlotte Hornets.</p>
        <p>One of the coolest websites for learning about the city of Charlotte is <a
                href="https://www.charlottesgotalot.com/things-to-do">fun things to do</a>. Here is
            a reference for <a
                href="http://travelsmaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/map-of-charlotte-north-carolina_6.gif"
                > a map of the city of Charlotte</a>.</p>
        <p>Each p element is a <strong>block</strong> element designed to make a block on the
            page.</p>
        <h2>What are block elements good for?</h2>
        <p>The next element after this is a ul, or <q>unordered list</q>. It makes a bulleted
            list. The list will contain some of my favorite players currently on the Hornets roster.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>LaMelo Ball</li>
            <li>Brandon Miller</li>
            <li>Miles Bridges</li>
            <li>Nick Smith Jr</li>
            <li>Mousa Diabate</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How about we look at an ol element, or <q>ordered</q> list? The code looks very similar
            to the <q>unordered</q> list. You have to see the difference by viewing in a web
            browser. This list will contain the Charlotte Hornets uniforms in order of usage throughout the season.</p>

            <li>Away</li>
